                            Shields up! Rrrrred alert! This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Talk about going nowhere fast. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Ensign Babyface! Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? Your head is not an artifact! Besides, you look good in a dress. The unexpected is our normal routine. Not if I weaken first. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here.

                            and attack the Romulans. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.

                            I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise."

                            I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. I'll alert the crew. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns.

                            You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. What? We're not at all alike! Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years?
