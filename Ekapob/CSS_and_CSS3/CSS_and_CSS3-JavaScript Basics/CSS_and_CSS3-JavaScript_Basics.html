                    You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. We have a saboteur aboard. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. How long can two people talk about nothing? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.

                            <span>Captain</span>, why are we out here chasing comets? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them.

                            I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. My oath is between <span>Captain Kargan</span> and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant?

                            What? We're not at all alike! Computer, belay that order. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Well, that's certainly good to know. Congratulations - you just destroyed the <span>Enterprise</span>.

                            For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, <span>Starfleet</span> is going to want a full investigation. Sorry, <span>Data</span>. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of <span>Starfleet</span>. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion?

                            About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with <span>Geordi</span>, or <span>Worf</span>.

                            Shields up! Rrrrred alert! What? We're not at all alike! Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Your shields were failing, sir. I'll alert the crew. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "<span>Enterprise</span>." Travel time to the nearest starbase? Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years?
